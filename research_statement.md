As an early-career researcher, ByteBoost provides a unique opportunity to develop skills and professional connections that supplement my postdoctoral training.
My current role is at the University of Michigan, where I am affiliated with the Ecology and Evolutionary Biology Department, the Center for the Study of Complex Systems, and the Schmidt AI in Science postdoctoral fellowship program.
ByteBoost participation will support early steps to establish my research agenda in scaling up agent-based models of evolution.

## Workshop Opportunities

The ByteBoost workshop provides several opportunities aligned to my career objectives, that are otherwise unavailable at my home institution.

I am excited to make full use of hardware access provisioned to workshop participants.
In particular, I plan to trial at scale my recent work on decentralized, approximate phylogenetic tracking methods for evolution simulations.
During the last semester, I collaborated with undergraduate researcher Connor Yang to implement an island-model evolution simulation for the Cerebras Wafer-Scale Engine (WSE).
We recently succeeded in running prototype code with approximate phylogenetic tracking end-to-end on the Cerebras WSE simulator.
The hands-on component of the workshop provides an ideal opportunity for initial experiments at-scale on hardware, which will allow us to assess how well our prototype code takes advantage of hardware capabilities and refine implementation strategy.

Additionally, the hands-on component of the workshop provides an ideal opportunity to build collaborations with peer early-career researchers who share interests in emerging HPC technologies.
My hope is that the workshop serves as an introduction to build relationships with a network of future leaders in scientific computing.
I also look forward to connecting with HPC technologists and systems administrators from leading academic computing centers.

Finally, I appreciate the opportunity for direct instruction on the underlying properties of Cerebras, Graphcore, Intel, NVIDIA, and Fujitsu A64FX hardware.
Cerebras' SDK documentation has provided some familiarity with the Cerebras Software Language (CSL), but ByteBoost participation will allow me to round out foundational hardware knowledge necessary to effectively leverage the full potential of the platform.
Although I have less familiarity exploring the hardware available at Ookami and ACES, I am looking forward to the opportunity to become acquainted.
The Graphcore Intelligence Processing Unit (IPU), in particular, seems potentially fruitful for future work with agent-based modeling.

## Career Goals

I am currently establishing initial stages of a research agenda pushing the boundaries of HPC in order to advance capabilities of evolutionary simulation.
In conjunction with my ByteBoost participation, I am presently developing an ACCESS Innovative Projects Proposal for hardware time on Neocortex and recently entered a preproposal to the US Department of Energy's EXPRESS 2024 funding opportunity under the Large Discrete/Agent-Based Models topic.
My workshop learning and capstone project will feed directly into these future research directions.

Ultimately, I hope to contribute to progress addressing open questions around open-ended evolution and major transitions in evolution (e.g., evolution of multicellularity) through sustained leadership laying foundations for application of emerging HPC technologies to agent-based modeling in digital evolution.
I anticipate such work benefiting broader classes of agent-based modeling, with digital evolution serving as a productive testbed for computational methods generalizable across parallel discrete event simulations.

## Empowering my Research Community

In the more immediate future, I intend to amplify the impact of my own workshop participation by sharing what I learn and create to benefit others in my research community.
I will do this in two ways.

1. Software Products:

Availability of usable, extendable software is key for adoption and productivity of new hardware platforms.
I hope to strengthen the community codebase by documenting, packaging, and sharing code developed during the workshop.
During the workshop, I am interested to learn best practices to organize, test, and distribute kernel/driver software components.
Given the cutting-edge nature of ByteBoost platforms, I expect to benefit in particular from discussion among workshop participants on this topic.

2. Knowledge Sharing:

I plan to report workshop highlights back to my peers at the BEACON Center for the Study of Evolution in Action and the Schmidt AI in Science postdoctoral cohort.
Both groups host rotating weekly meetings ideal for this purpose.
Within my home lab group, I will relay knowledge to undergraduate mentee Connor Yang, who is currently assisting with CSL projects.
