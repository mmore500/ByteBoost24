As an early-career researcher, ByteBoost provides a unique opportunity to develop skills and professional connections that further my career goals in large-scale agent-based modeling.
In my current role, I serve as a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Michigan, where I am affiliated with the Ecology and Evolutionary Biology Department, the Center for the Study of Complex Systems, and the Schmidt AI in Science postdoctoral fellowship program.
Workshop participation will provide key supplements to my postdoctoral training, ultimately enabling early steps to establish my research agenda in scaling up agent-based models of evolution.

## Workshop Opportunities

The ByteBoost workshop provides several opportunities aligned to my career objectives otherwise unavailable at my home institution.
I am excited to make full use of hardware access provisioned to workshop participants to trial research software related to my recent work on decentralized phylogenetic tracking in evolution simulations.
During the last semester, I collaborated with undergraduate researcher Connor Yang to implement an island-model evolution simulation for the Cerebras Wafer-Scale Engine (WSE).
We recently succeeded in running a prototype end-to-end on the Cerebras SDK hardware simulator.
The hands-on component of the workshop provides an ideal opportunity to experiment with these simulation approaches at-scale on hardware, which will allow us to assess how well our initial approach takes advantage of hardware capabilities and refine implementation strategy.

The hands-on component of the workshop also provides an ideal opportunity to build collaborations with peer early-career researchers who share interests in emerging HPC technologies.
My hope is that the workshop serves as an introduction to build relationships with a network of future leaders in scientific computing.
I also hope to connect with HPC technologists and systems administrators from leading academic computing centers.

Finally, I see significant benefit in the workshop's direct instruction on the underlying properties of Cerebras, Graphcore, Intel, NVIDIA, and Fujitsu A64FX hardware.
Although Cerebras' SDK documentation has provided some familiarity with the Cerebras Software Language (CSL), ByteBoost participation will allow me to round out foundational knowledge necessary to effectively leverage the full potential of the platform.
I have less familiarity exploring hardware available at Ookami and ACES, and I am looking forward to the opportunity to become acquainted.
In particular, the Graphcore Intelligence Processing Unit (IPU) or similar classes of accelerator hardware prove fruitful for future work with agent-based modeling.

## Career Goals

Workshop participation will help me navigate the first stages of a research agenda that pushes the boundaries of HPC to advance capabilities of evolutionary simulation.
In conjunction with my ByteBoost participation, I am presently developing an ACCESS Innovative Projects Proposal for hardware time on Neocortex and recently entered a preproposal to the US Department of Energy's EXPRESS 2024 funding opportunity under the Large Discrete/Agent-Based Models topic.
My workshop learning and capstone project will feed directly into these research activities.
Ultimately, I hope to contribute to progress addressing open questions around open-ended evolution and major transitions in evolution (e.g., evolution of multicellularity) through sustained leadership laying foundations for application of emerging HPC technologies to agent-based modeling in digital evolution.
I anticipate such work benefiting broader classes of agent-based modeling, with digital evolution serving as a productive testbed for generalizable computational methods for parallel discrete event simulation.

## Empowering my Research Community

In the more immediate future, I hope to extend the impact of my own workshop participation by sharing what I learn and create to benefit others in my research community.
I will do this in two ways.

1. Software Products:

Availability of usable, extendable software significantly drives adoption and productivity of any new research platform.
I hope to strengthen the community codebase by documenting, packaging, and sharing code developed during the workshop.
Given the cutting-edge nature of ByteBoost platforms, I anticipate great benefit learning best practices to organize, test, and distribute on-device kernel/on-host driver software components through discussion with other workshop participants.

2. Knowledge Sharing:

I plan to report workshop highlights back to my peers at the BEACON Center for the Study of Evolution in Action and the Schmidt AI in Science Postdoc Program.
Both groups host rotating weekly meetings ideal for this purpose.
Within my home lab group, I will relay knowledge to undergraduate mentee Connor Yang, who is currently assisting with CSL projects.
