As an early-career researcher, ByteBoost provides a valuable opportunity to develop skills and professional connections to further my career goals to equip the digital evolution community to achieve radically scaled-up simulation.
In particular, TODO.
I will roll workshop participation into a broader nascent research agenda.
In conjunction, I am presently developing an ACCESS Innovative Projects Proposal and recently entered a preproposal to the Dept. of Energy's EXPRESS 2024 FOA.
Ultimately, proposed work takes first steps in sustained leadership laying foundations for application of new accelerator technologies to agent-based modeling in digital evolution and beyond.


I hope to amplify the impact of my own ByteBoost participation by sharing what I learn and create to empower others in my research community in two ways.

1.Software Products:

Availability of usable, extendable software significantly drives adoption and productivity of any new research platform.
I hope to strengthen community codebase by documenting, packaging, and sharing code developed during the course of the workshop.
Given the cutting-edge nature of ByteBoost platforms, I anticipate great benefit learning best practices to organize, test, and distribute on-device kernel/on-host driver software components through discussion with other workshop participants.

2. Knowledge Sharing:

I plan to report workshop highlights back to my peers at the BEACON Center for the Study of Evolution in Action and the Schmidt AI in Science Postdoc Program.
Both groups host rotating weekly meetings ideal for this purpose.
Within my own lab group, I will relay knowledge to undergraduate mentee Connor Yang currently working on CSL projects.
