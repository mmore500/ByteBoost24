As an early-career researcher, ByteBoost provides a unique opportunity to develop skills and professional connections that further my career goals in large-scale agent-based modeling.
In my current role, I serve as a postdoctoral researcher at University of Michigan, affiliated with the Ecology and Evolutionary Biology Department, the Center for the Study of Complex Systems, and the Schmidt AI in Science postdoctoral fellowship program.
Workshop participation will provide key supplements to my postdoctoral training, ultimately enabling me to make the next steps to advance my research agenda scaling up agent-based models of evolutionary processes.

## Workshop Opportunities

The ByteBoost workshop provides several opportunities aligned to my career objectives otherwise unavailable at my home institution.
I am excited to make full use of hardware access provisioned to workshop participants to trial research software related to my recent work on decentralized phylogenetic tracking in evolution simulations.
This last semester, I have collaborated with undergraduate researcher Connor Yang to implement an island-model evolution simulation for the Cerebras Wafer-Scale Engine (WSE).
We recently got a prototype running end-to-end on the Cerebras SDK hardware simulator.
The hands-on component of the workshop provides an ideal opportunity to experiment with these simulation approaches at-scale on hardware, which will allow us to assess how well our initial approach takes advantage of hardware capabilities and refine implementation strategy.

The hands-on component of the workshop also provides an ideal opportunity to build collaborations with peer early-career researchers who share interests in emerging HPC technologies.
My hope is that the workshop serves as an introduction to build relationships with a network of future leaders in scientific computing.
I also hope to connect with HPC technologists and systems administrators from leading academic computing centers.

Finally, I see significant benefit in the workshop's direct instruction on the underlying structure of Cerebras, Graphcore, and Fujitsu A64FX hardware.
Cerebras' SDK documentation has provided some familiarity with the Cerebras Software Library (CSL), but TODO will more effectively leverage the full potential of the platform.
The workshop structure will provide to tackle.
Although I have less familiarity with the Graphcore Intelligence Processing Unit (IPU), this accelerator TODO good fit with my research.

## Career Goals

Ultimately, I will roll workshop participation into a research agenda that pushes the boundaries of HPC to advance capabilities of evolutionary simulation.
Talk about hardware access
In conjunction, I am presently developing an ACCESS Innovative Projects Proposal and recently entered a preproposal to the Dept. of Energy's EXPRESS 2024 FOA.
Proposed work takes first steps in sustained leadership laying foundations for application of new accelerator technologies to agent-based modeling in digital evolution and beyond.
I see great potential for applications of HPC to questions revolving around open-ended evolution and major transitions in evolution (e.g., evolution of multicellularity) in my research community,
My long-term goal is to equip the digital evolution community to achieve radically scaled-up simulation

## Empowering my Research Community

In the more immediate future, I hope to extend the impact of my own workshop participation by sharing what I learn and create to benefit others in my research community.
I will do this in two ways.

1. Software Products:

Availability of usable, extendable software significantly drives adoption and productivity of any new research platform.
I hope to strengthen community codebase by documenting, packaging, and sharing code developed during the course of the workshop.
Given the cutting-edge nature of ByteBoost platforms, I anticipate great benefit learning best practices to organize, test, and distribute on-device kernel/on-host driver software components through discussion with other workshop participants.

2. Knowledge Sharing:

I plan to report workshop highlights back to my peers at the BEACON Center for the Study of Evolution in Action and the Schmidt AI in Science Postdoc Program.
Both groups host rotating weekly meetings ideal for this purpose.
Within my home lab group, I will relay knowledge to undergraduate mentee Connor Yang currently working on CSL projects.
