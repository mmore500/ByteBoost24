\section{Introduction}
Evolutionary processes underlie key questions in public health, medicine, and natural resources management.
In conjunction with benchtop experiments and observational studies, mathematical and computational models play a key role in understanding evolutionary processes underpinning critical problems like epidemiology, antibiotic resistance, cancer biology, and conservation biology.
Emerging High-Performance Computing (HPC) hardware like the Cerebras Wafer-Scale Engine (WSE) and Graphcore Intelligence Processing Unit (IPU) will enable detailed modeling of key cross-scale evolutionary phenomena, such as transitions of individuality (e.g., multicellularity) and evo-epidemiological tradeoffs between pathogens' within-host dynamics and between-host transmissibility \cite{goldsby2020major,schreiber2021evolutionary}.

\section{Objectives}

The proposed workshop project will explore foundational algorithms and supporting software (e.g., Cerebras Software Language [CSL], Poplar) necessary to harness emerging HPC hardware accelerators for agent-based evolution research.
Developed simulation will investigate how population structure and rare mutational events influence selective sweep frequency within very large populations.
Among other application areas, sweep dynamics are pivotal to understanding how new pathogen strains emerge and establish within host populations \cite{markov2023evolution}.

\section{Methods}

To succeed as a tool for scientific research, simulation must be sufficiently observable.
In the case of evolutionary simulation, phylogenetic history (i.e., ancestry trees) is key to assessing the mode and tempo of evolution.

\input{fig/runtime-posthoc-schematic.tex}

Proposed work builds on recently-introduced \textit{hereditary stratigraphy} (HStrat) methods designed to enable characterization evolutionary history in highly-distributed simulations \cite{moreno2022hstrat}.
These methods mark population members with a special annotation akin to noncoding DNA, inherited by each consecutive generation.
After simulation ends, HStrat markers facilitate fast and accurate reconstruction of phylogenetic history.
This procedure, summarized in Figure \ref{fig:runtime-posthoc-schematic}, analogizes use of DNA sequence data to infer phylogenies of natural systems.
Unlike direct lineage tracking, HStrat methods scale gracefully to long-running multiprocess simulation \cite{moreno2024analysis}.
Markers can be as small as 96 bits.

Simulation will use an island model to harness HPC accelerator processing power.
This approach instantiates separate agent subpopulations per processor, with agents occasionally migrated between subpopulations.
Global population structure results from rates of agent migration and the pattern of connectivity between islands.

A simple agent model suffices for proposed work, with agent traits abstracted to a floating point ``fitness'' value encoded directly in agent genomes.
Fitness landscape properties can be tuned through choice of mutation operator.
For instance, high probability deleterious outcomes would simulate a rugged landscape.

\section{Proposed Work}

Project work will focus on the Cererbras WSE platform.
Workshop activities will build on recent initial implementation of HStrat-enabled island model evolutionary simulation in CSL via the v1.0.0 Cerebras SDK.
Prototype code is available via GitHub at \texttt{\href{https://hopth.ru/cl}{hopth.ru/cl}}.
Several engineering problems suited to workshop scope remain unresolved:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Agent migration between distant processing elements}.
Possible strategies include stochastic forwarding or more structured wavelet routing schemes.
This capability enables manipulation of population structure via island capability as an experimental variable.

\item \textbf{On-the-fly device-to-host genome sampling.}
Recording evolutionary intermediates over simulation runtime can help characterize evolutionary history, akin to a ``fossil record.''

\section{Outcomes}

TODO

% will catalyze research.
% Progress on this front
% How to , to directly create modules during the workshop that can be shared.
% If there aren’t established protocols, the workshop environment would be a great place to discuss these issues.


% What is the structural relationship between individual-level phylogenies and species-level phylogenies?
% Do they respond in the same way to evolutionary conditions like selection pressure, ecology, and spatial structure?
